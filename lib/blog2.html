     <h2>CSS Variables</h2>
    <p>
    Syntax of the var() Function
    The var() function is used to insert the value of a CSS variable.
    The syntax of the var() function is as follows:
    <strong>var(--name, value)</strong>
    name:	Required. The variable name (must start with two dashes)
    value:	Optional. The fallback value (used if the variable is not found)
    Note: The variable name must begin with two dashes (--) and it is case sensitive!
 </p>
    
    
    <h2>How var() Works</h2>
    <p>First of all: CSS variables can have a global or local scope.

        Global variables can be accessed/used through the entire document, while local variables can be used only inside the selector where it is declared.
        
        To create a variable with global scope, declare it inside the :root selector. The :root selector matches the document's root element.
        
        To create a variable with local scope, declare it inside the selector that is going to use it.
        
        The following example is equal to the example above, but here we use the var() function.
        
        First, we declare two global variables (--blue and --white). Then, we use the var() function to insert the value of the variables later in the style sheet:

    <h2>Change Variables With JavaScript</h2>
    <p>CSS variables have access to the DOM, 
       which means that you can change them with JavaScript.
       Here is an example of how you can create a script to display and change 
       the --blue variable from the example used in the previous pages. For now, 
    do not worry if you are not familiar with JavaScript.</p>

    <h2>Overriding Global Variables With Local Variables</h2>
    <p>From the previous page we have learned that global variables can be 
    accessed/used through the entire document, while local variables can be 
    used only inside the selector where it is declared.
